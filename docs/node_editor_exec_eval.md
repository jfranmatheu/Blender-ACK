# ACK Execution Node Editor System Analysis

This document analyzes the execution-focused node editor system built upon the ACK framework, specifically examining:
- `ackit/ne/btypes/node_tree_exec.py`
- `ackit/ne/btypes/node_exec.py`
- `ackit/ne/btypes/node_socket_exec.py`
- (Utilizing bases `ackit/ne/btypes/base_tree.py` and `ackit/ne/btypes/base_node.py`)

This system presents a distinct execution model compared to the data-flow `NodeTree`/`Node` system.

## 1. Node Tree Type and Purpose

-   **Graph Structure:** Like the data-flow system, this uses a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)** structure.
-   **Execution Model:** This system implements a **backward-propagating execution** or **control-flow** model. Execution is explicitly initiated from a designated "output" or "root" node and flows *backwards* through specific input sockets (`NodeSocketExec`).
-   **Purpose:** This design is typically suited for tasks where the flow of control or execution context is paramount, rather than the continuous flow of data. Examples include defining UI layouts (as suggested by the `layout_node_editor` test directory and mentions of `parent_layout` in comments), state machines, or procedural command sequences.

## 2. Execution Triggering Mechanism

-   **Explicit Call:** Execution is *not* automatically triggered by graph changes or property updates in the same way as the data-flow system. Instead, it must be explicitly initiated by calling the `NodeTreeExec.execute(*args, **kwargs)` method on the node tree instance.
-   **No `update()` Trigger:** The `NodeTreeExec.update()` method exists (inherited and overridden from `BaseNodeTree`) but is explicitly designed *not* to trigger execution; it currently only clears tagged links.
-   **No Property Trigger:** The `NodeExec.on_property_update()` method is overridden to do nothing (`pass`), meaning changes to node properties do not automatically trigger re-execution.

## 3. Execution Flow and Direction

-   **Starting Point:** Execution begins when `NodeTreeExec.execute()` is called.
    1.  It identifies a specific **output node** within the tree, determined by matching `node.__class__` against the tree's `output_node_type` attribute.
    2.  It initializes an `execution_tracker` set to prevent infinite loops in case of unforeseen cycles (though cycles should ideally be prevented by link validation).
    3.  It calls the internal execution method `_internal_execute(*args, _execution_tracker=execution_tracker, **kwargs)` on this identified output node.
-   **Direction:** Execution flows **backwards** (or perhaps more accurately, **inwards** from the perspective of the output node) through the graph.
-   **Node Processing (`NodeExec._internal_execute()`):**
    1.  **Tracker Check:** Prevents re-execution of the same node instance within a single `execute()` call.
    2.  **User Logic (`_execute`/`execute`):** It calls the node's primary logic method, `_execute()` (which by default calls the user-overridable `execute()`). This method performs the node's specific action and, crucially, can return a dictionary (`socket_specific_kwargs_map`).
    3.  **Context Propagation:** The returned `socket_specific_kwargs_map` dictates how execution proceeds *backwards* into connected nodes. It maps specific *input* socket identifiers (e.g., `'InContent'`) to dictionaries of keyword arguments (`kwargs`) that should be passed *only* to the nodes connected to that specific input socket.
    4.  **Recursive Call:** It iterates through the node's `NodeSocketExec` *input* sockets. For each linked input socket:
        - It prepares a `child_kwargs` dictionary, starting with the `kwargs` received by the current node and updating it with any specific arguments found in `socket_specific_kwargs_map` for that particular input socket.
        - It finds the node connected to the *other end* of the link (`link.from_node` - the node whose output is connected to this node's input).
        - It recursively calls `_internal_execute()` on that `child_node` (which is actually the parent/provider in the graph structure), passing the original `*args` and the potentially modified `child_kwargs`.
-   **`NodeExec.execute()` Override:** Subclasses of `NodeExec` *must* override the `execute(*args, **kwargs)` method. This is where the node's specific action (e.g., creating a UI element, performing a calculation) is implemented. It receives arguments propagated from the execution call chain and returns the optional dictionary to control context passing to nodes connected to its inputs.
-   **Disabled Methods:** `NodeExec` explicitly raises `NotImplementedError` for `process()` and `evaluate()`, reinforcing that it does not use the forward data-flow evaluation mechanism.

## 4. Data/Argument Passing

-   **Keyword Arguments (`kwargs`):** Data and execution context are passed primarily through keyword arguments (`kwargs`). The initial call to `NodeTreeExec.execute()` can provide starting arguments.
-   **Contextual Modification:** The core mechanism for controlling execution context is the dictionary returned by `NodeExec.execute()`. This allows a node to modify or add specific keyword arguments (`kwargs`) that are *only* passed to the subgraph connected to a particular input socket. This is essential for tasks like UI layout where a container node needs to pass a specific `parent_layout` object only to the nodes defining its contents.
-   **Positional Arguments (`args`):** Positional arguments (`*args`) are passed down the chain unmodified.
-   **No Socket Values:** Unlike `NodeSocket`, `NodeSocketExec` does not have a `.value` property or `get_value`/`set_value` methods. It acts purely as a connection point for control flow, not for retrieving computed data values across links. Its `value_type` property exists but mainly reflects the type hint for documentation or potential future use.

## 5. Role of Sockets (`NodeSocketExec`)

-   **Control Flow Points:** `NodeSocketExec` instances serve primarily as connection points defining the pathways for the backward-propagating execution flow.
-   **No Data Transfer:** They do not store or transfer computed data values like `NodeSocket`. Their purpose is structural linkage for the execution traversal.
-   **Type Hinting:** They retain the `Generic[T]` and `value_type` property, likely for type hinting and clarity about what *kind* of connection point they represent, even if they don't hold runtime values.
-   **Basic Functionality:** They provide methods to get links (`get_links`) and connected nodes (`get_connected_nodes`), which are used internally by `NodeExec` during execution traversal.

## 6. Core Classes and Responsibilities

-   **`NodeTreeExec`:**
    -   Manages the overall graph.
    -   Defines the `output_node_type` to identify the execution starting point.
    -   Provides the entry point for execution (`execute`).
    -   Orchestrates the initiation of the backward execution flow.
-   **`NodeExec`:**
    -   Represents an executable unit in the control-flow graph.
    -   Defines the recursive execution logic (`_internal_execute`).
    -   Requires subclasses to implement the core action (`execute`).
    -   Handles the contextual passing of arguments (`kwargs`) based on the return value of `execute()`.
    -   Disables data-flow methods (`process`, `evaluate`).
-   **`NodeSocketExec`:**
    -   Acts as a typed connection point for control flow.
    -   Does *not* handle data value transfer.
    -   Used by `NodeExec` to identify paths for recursive execution calls.

## 7. Customization and Extension

-   **New Executable Nodes:** Create subclasses of `NodeExec`. Override the `execute(*args, **kwargs)` method to implement the desired action and return the appropriate `socket_specific_kwargs_map` if contextual arguments need to be passed to specific input branches.
-   **New Execution Socket Types:** While possible to subclass `NodeSocketExec`, it seems less common than subclassing `NodeSocket`, as `NodeSocketExec` primarily serves a structural role. Subclassing might be done for specific type hinting or visual distinction (e.g., defining custom `color`).
-   **New Execution Trees:** Create subclasses of `NodeTreeExec`, primarily to define the specific `output_node_type` that acts as the root for execution in that tree type.

## Summary

The ACK Execution Node System (`NodeTreeExec`, `NodeExec`, `NodeSocketExec`) provides a framework for building node graphs based on control flow rather than data flow. Execution starts from a designated output node and propagates backward/inward through linked `NodeSocketExec` inputs. Data and context are passed via `*args` and especially `**kwargs`, with a mechanism allowing nodes to provide specific context to different input branches. This design is well-suited for procedural tasks, command sequences, or UI generation where the order and context of execution are key.
